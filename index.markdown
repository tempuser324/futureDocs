### Smaller section here
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3
    - Step 3 has you `running one tiny command`

    - Great job on that confirmation


### Acknowledgment
- I am apologizing for not having proper content to share with you today
- Though the documentation tips are very helpful
- Markdown is super easy, but, too many bullets in the .md world
- [Hello world link](google.com)




### Giant code block

```
whole bunch of like.... python stuff or other stuff
import json
import csv
import requests

baseURL = ''
user = ''

print ('This kind of looks real, right?')
```
